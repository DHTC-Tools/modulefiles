Hi Nepomuk,

 It looks like pegasus got its own email notification system and works at different stages. Going through the manual what I see is that the notification may be turned on based on jobs, dags, errors or just after completing all the jobs. 

https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/notifications.php
https://pegasus.isi.edu/documentation/dax_generator_api.php

Unfortunately, I could not find a clean example. So let me check this one with Mats (who knows pegasus in detail than me) and get back to you.

To compile your code against root:
1) ssh to login.osgconnect.net ( we will check how this works on xd-login later)
2) module load root
3) now compile your code

Once you have the static binary, transfer the binary to the remote worker machine along with your job using transfer_input_files keyword. To set the requirements, add the following line in your HTCondor job description file

requirements = Has_Modules == True


 You also need to load the specific module(s) before your program execution
#!/bin/bash

module load root
my_prog_bin < input > output (your program execution)


Please take a look at the documentation on OASIS modules: https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000634394-accessing-software-using-distributed-environment-modules
More about describing job requirements: https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/5000633467-steer-your-jobs-with-htcondor-job-requirements

Please feel free to send us further questions or need additional information.
