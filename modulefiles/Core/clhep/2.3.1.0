The CLHEP project was proposed by Leif LÃ¶nnblad at CHEP 92. It is intended to be
a set of HEP-specific foundation and utility classes such as random generators,
physics vectors, geometry and linear algebra. CLHEP is structured in a set of
packages independent of any external package (interdependencies within CLHEP are
allowed under certain conditions).
